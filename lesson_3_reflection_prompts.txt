good way to have a backup of work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  hmm. the remote can be used for shared work. so I might want to make sure my
  work is ready to be shared and used within a larger body of work.
  I might also want to pull only some changes from this shared body of work that
  Im interested in working on. so helps to keep things orderly.
