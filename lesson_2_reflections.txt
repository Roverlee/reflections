-----How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

looks like with git reset hard I erased some of my earlier changes to this Id not committed ! :()

can use git diff to compare staging area to the working directory, and then use git diff --staged
to compare the staging area and the repository,
and so have a good idea of what I want to commit makes sense
and is a logical commit, ie isn't too big and groups one type of change together etc


------What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

when I want to try something different that makes sense, like a spanish language version, or perhaps
change the data set to try something different, but not entirely sure how different it would be to be a branch!
